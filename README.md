- Working link to the experiment -
In this experiment, we replicated the 1984 Cleveland-McGill study.
We created four different visualizations for the same data.
The visualizations that we used were pie charts, bar charts, tree maps, and stacked bar charts.
We wanted to determine how well people could define the ratio between two subsections of the graphs.
We had six datapoints -> ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
For each of the four different visualizations, we gathered estimations about the ratios between A:B, A:C, A:D, A:F, E:F, and C:D.
By repeating the same comparisons across differnet visualizations, we were able to determine that
- BEST PERFORMER -
was the easiest to accurately estimate size ratios.
Throughout our study, we found that the -BEST PERFORMER- had an accuracy of -ACCURACCY-.
-2nd- had an accuracy of -ACCURACCY-
-3rd- had an accuracy of -ACCURACCY-
-4th- had an accuracy of -ACCURACCY-


## Visualizations
- Display the visualizations we tested
- Include screenshots from the trials, not just generic images
- Order these based on performance (Best -> Worst)

- Display the average log2Error calculations for each visualization across all of the trials
- Bootstrapped 95% Confidence Intervals for upper and lower bounds
